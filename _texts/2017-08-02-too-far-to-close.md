title: Too far to close
author: Pankesh Bamotra
---

- We walked hand in hand through summers and winters,
- The warmth of your skin solaced the chill of my heart,
- You were the answer to all my questions,
- You were the most beautiful thing I lost, and it hurts like splinters,
- We were the angels with a pinch of perfection,
- You were in disguise the totality of all heavens,
- We walked too far to close the chapters we started together,
- At times I silently cry for losing you and all the inaction,
- You are, you were, you will be my most beautiful memory,
- The memory I make sure that I forget everyday,
- I miss those moments touching your skin, hair, lips, the heart,
- Whilst I forget them I want you to fade away like a dream,
- I talk about you much but only with myself,
- You are indescribable, so I shush my words,
- I don't want to be a forgotten memory to you,
- And I wish you love me in memories thyself,
- My cries don't leave my throat often,
- I press my nerves to present a happy me,
- I pray to be a no one to your being,
- A no one that makes your heart soften.
- I meet the divine when I bring my eyelids close,
- Each time it is harder to ask him for help,
- I hold myself on my own, get up with face up,
- Thinking of your grace that's innocent as a rose,
- I think that I think so much of you,
- Probably you are thinking so much of me,
- Are the silences comfortable to you hon?
- Because I've forgotten how to love you
- I'm far, farther that you think
- Yet too close are you to this heart,
- Will you help me one last time?
- Come back to me and tell me how not to sink... 
- <i>In your memories</i>
