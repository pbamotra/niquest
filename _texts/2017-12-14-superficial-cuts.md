title: superficial cuts
author: Pankesh Bamotra

- What would it take to make a cut?
- Cut a little deep, then deeper, until it has severed the dilapidated heart?
- A knife, a broken glass, blunt scissors, or shrapnels of hurtful intentions?
- I think I've cut myself with each one, at least once or twice.
- I think you get used to pain, so much that it feels like everything else, 
- everything like breathing, living, kissing, touching, leaving, missing, dying, living, dying, living, dying, living, loving,
- But everytime I die it's like superficial cuts on heart making it half the size yet twice as strong.
- Strength makes you numb and a wise would call it life. 
- So let's cheer for every broken heart. 
- {:.indent-3} <i>They're probably tougher, wiser, and more humane than yours.</i>
