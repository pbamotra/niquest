title: Crushed on first sight

- She was a flawless beauty, dusky yet warm,
- I mean so graceful, that I couldn't keep calm,
- I had to talk to her, but couldn't ask her out,
- Oh the endless thoughts, and my brain would shout,
- "She's the one, go get her", said the voice,
- I was so lost in her coz I had no other choice,
- One day she called my name, my heart elated,
- 'Twas a normal day and she wished me for birthday belated,
- I was feeling born again, that omg I'm the selected,
- I had a dream and I could see it perfected,
- Days and nights passed, we became friends,
- I couldn't say the truth that I wanted to walk to the ends,
- She meant the world to me, the love of my life, God bless,
- I think she was falling for me, luck was on my side I guess.
- She proposed me and I was jumping on my bed,
- We were serious and tied the dreams on thread,
- I loved the way she curled her lips to say to say my name,
- She was my love, my heart, my life, the push, the flame,
- I loved the way she looked in the pink dress,
- Shh I never told her I loved her in every dress,
- The way she tied her hair, the veil on her face,
- More the time passed the more I loved her grace,
- We fought, we cried, we consoled, we smiled together,
- At times we fell apart but just to be closer than ever,
- She flew away to another place, I felt alone,
- Her warmth kept me smiling and sadness begone,
- Busier were the days to follow, I couldn't give my best,
- Was that the reason she began losing interest?
- How could that be when she knows my heart is hers,
- I was losing the rhyme of life,
- She was upset, why couldn't I get things right,
- She was upset, why couldn't I make things bright,
- She was upset, why couldn't I make her heart light,
- Upset was I, wrong, broken, she was getting out of sight,
- She had her reasons locked in her heart I felt betrayed,
- Couldn't speak to her for a long, was totally dismayed,
- But how could I live without talking to her,
- I mustered all my courage and binged her,
- She was angry the way I went away quietly,
- I told her that I loved her more than before and mightily,
- She was no more the person I once loved,
- She is lost, upset, fallen but my beloved,
- I want to be with her again, she fears that thought,
- This time I'll keep aside love and make sure,
- that she is not upset, not lost, not fallen, and brighter than the girl I first met.
